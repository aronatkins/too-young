in this 
<BR>time and place,
<BR>life doesn't matter.
<BR>people don't care.
<BR>they only watch out
<BR>for themselves,
<BR>and don't give a damn
<BR>about others.
<BR>but if you step back,
<BR>for once, from being
<BR>selfish, you will
<BR>see the truth in the
<BR>world around you.
<BR>you will realize that
<BR>life isn't always as you
<BR>want it.
<BR>people don't realize
<BR>how much they have,
<BR>and take everything
<BR>for granted,
<BR>and when they lose
<BR>something or someone 
<BR>they love,
<BR>their life turns so
<BR>dark and hateful.
<BR>then they turn to
<BR>everyone to have pity
<BR>one them, and to love them,
<BR>but because they don't
<BR>understand, they
<BR>will never be loved,
<BR>nor allow themselves to love,
<BR>because people just don't care.
