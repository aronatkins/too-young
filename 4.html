<CENTER>Being my friend, she asked you. she asked you the question I wanted to ask you since I first met you. since our eyes first met. the reason I didn't ask you myself isn't because I'm shy, but because I'm afraid of rejection, and because I love you so much, I didn't. I had thought that if someone asks you for me, it wouldn't hurt as much. but now I know I was wrong. even though you never said no.
<BR>
<BR>You never said yes, either. you just go on as if it never happened. I know I'll never forget. I would have my friend ask you again, but she is too embarrassed. knowing never if you would ever say yes, knowing never if you would say no. but every time you walk by and we say hi, I hope that there would be a chance that you would answer the question and tell me yes. but as I wait here, all alone for that one word answer, I wish that I had asked you the moment I first set eyes on you, because I now probably will never know the answer to my one question. no matter what the answer may be, or even if you never answer me, you will always have a special place in my heart where I will always remember every time I say you. how you made me smile just by walking by and saying hi. you always brighten my day. and no matter what happens, I will always want to be your friend.
<BR>
<BR>I will always love you.
