<H2>Eternal Darkness</H2>
Living in tears and
<BR>eternal darkness.
<BR>Everything looks so
<BR>distant and unreal to me.
<BR>My tears seem to
<BR>comfort me and
<BR>the eternal darkness
<BR>wraps around me
<BR>like a mother's arms
<BR>to her child.
<BR>There is a question
<BR>at the back of my mind.
<BR>A question which has
<BR>no answer.
<BR>In the darkness,
<BR>a faint light awakens life.
<BR>In the distance, in
<BR>the dim light,
<BR>there is the outline
<BR>of the path which I
<BR>have to take.
<BR>This is one path,
<BR>chosen for me instead
<BR>of chosen by me.
<BR>As I start on my way,
<BR>the light flickers off,
<BR>but I continue along
<BR>the dark, unknown path.
<BR>The path I am taking
<BR>twists and turns, rises
<BR>and falls, like a roller coaster.
<BR>It's very rocky and
<BR>unsafe. Abruptly,
<BR>it stops, and there is
<BR>no way to retrace my
<BR>steps, for they have
<BR>worn down to nothing
<BR>throughout the years
<BR>I have been walking.
<BR>I look around me for
<BR>the first time,
<BR>and I see no one beside me.
<BR>This path I was forced
<BR>to take alone.
<BR>I see my best friend
<BR>and run to him,
<BR>but he is just an illusion.
<BR>All of a sudden,
<BR>I am falling with
<BR>no one to catch me.
<BR>In dreams, you always
<BR>wake up before you
<BR>hit the bottom,
<BR>but this is no dream.
<BR>Though it seems unreal,
<BR>it is reality.
<BR>I sit down and cry my tears.
<BR>They fall, seeming as though
<BR>they never want to stop.
<BR>I wait to be
<BR>comforted, though no one
<BR>is there.
<BR>I wait in silence for
<BR>a steady hand to help me
<BR>along the way. The more I wait,
<BR>the worse the path gets,
<BR>though I don't know.
<BR>No one came and answered
<BR>my cries, so I got up,
<BR>brushed myself off,
<BR>and started again, along my way.
<BR>The road I am walking upon
<BR>stopped again, as though
<BR>not sure where to go.
<BR>I do all I can to get
<BR>back on the lighted path,
<BR>but it is no use, and
<BR>I give up.
<BR>My path became unbearable,
<BR>I look for my best friend
<BR>to comfort me,
<BR>but he is not there,
<BR>not even as an illusion.
<BR>I am…
<BR>Living in my tears
<BR>and eternal darkness.
