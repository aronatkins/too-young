Drifting apart, going
<BR>our own ways.
<BR>It seems like only
<BR>yesterday when we
<BR>became friends, even
<BR>though it was years ago.
<BR>We've gone through
<BR>a lot together, but
<BR>no one stays friends
<BR>forever. I'd say we were
<BR>fair weathered friends,
<BR>but it's not always true.
<BR>It seems like all
<BR>we ever do is fight,
<BR>and most of the fights
<BR>we don't know what
<BR>they are about.
<BR>Someday, after we
<BR>finally go our
<BR>separate ways,
<BR>our paths will
<BR>meet again, and like
<BR>Brandy's song,
<BR>we again will be,
<BR>Best Friends.
