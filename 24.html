I look at you
<BR>through my tears,
<BR>watching you,
<BR>figuring out all your fears.
<BR>I know I can't stay away,
<BR>not even for just today.
<BR>I look so sad,
<BR>I want to cry,
<BR>but then you'll tell me
<BR>it's time to say bye-bye.
<BR>Bye-bye to my love for you.
<BR>To me, you will never be true.
<BR>I tell you I love you,
<BR>but you look the other way
<BR>though I whisper to you ‘stay.'
<BR>Again you see my tears
<BR>and choose to look away.
<BR>There I am,
<BR>crying for you to stay.
<BR>Are you scared-
<BR>I see it in your eyes,
<BR>but then you cover
<BR>it up with all of those lies.
<BR>You say I'm a friend,
<BR>but I promise you my feelings
<BR>for you will never end.
<BR>I need you.
<BR>I want you.
<BR>I kiss you.
<BR>I miss you.
<BR>I hold you.
<BR>I love you.
