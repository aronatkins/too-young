Two different worlds,
<BR>meeting to become one.
<BR>But we're so far apart,
<BR>there is no chance
<BR>to meet, no time for
<BR>love. Words spoken
<BR>though not heart; that
<BR>is the only way I know
<BR>you. But I've seen you.
<BR>You've never seen me, but no matter
<BR>how many miles between us,
<BR>and the way we never knew
<BR>each other besides those few
<BR>words, you have become
<BR>someone special to me,
<BR>someone I can never give up.
<BR>You seem to be different
<BR>that anyone I know, but
<BR>maybe that's why I love
<BR>you so much. But no one,
<BR>not even you, will ever
<BR>know how I feel.
