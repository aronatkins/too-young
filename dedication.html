<H1>Knowing Everything Too Young: Dedication</H1>
</CENTER>

I dedicate this book to Joshua Bowling, my first true love and the one
who inspired me to write most of my poems, one of my best friends, Christine
Perkins, who has always been there for me, my friend Vinny-his name says
it all, and my loving mother Linda Atkins, who died when I was 11, in 1993.
She inspired a lit of my poems. I also want to dedicate this to all my
friends from U-Mass for a great summer and wonderful friendships to be
cherished forever. And of course, I can't forget all of the rest of my
friends who have always been there for me. Last, but not least, I want
to dedicate this to Erika and Krystal and all of the other foster sisters
and brothers I have had. I know you're out there somewhere and I want you
to know I love you and think of you often.
