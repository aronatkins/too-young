<H2>Elizabeth</H2>
						What does she have
<BR>						that I can't give you?
<BR>						From her, you get nothing,
<BR>						but from me; love.
<BR>						Say Good-bye to the past,
<BR>						whatever is there
<BR>						that you won't tell me.
<BR>
<BR>Tears run down my face,
<BR>knowing that you'll
<BR>never see anything
<BR>but her; never me.
<BR>Though I'll love you
<BR>and never will say
<BR>good-bye to my love
<BR>for you, things between
<BR>us will never go beyond
<BR>friendship and
<BR>you'll never really
<BR>trust me.
<BR>While you wait
<BR>for her, you pass
<BR>me by as nothing
<BR>but a slight friend.
<BR>It's hard to have
<BR>the feeling of love
<BR>for someone who sees
<BR>you as barely
<BR>a friend.
<BR>"Elizabeth, I don't even
<BR>know you, but for stealing
<BR>the one I love, never
<BR>returning his heart;
<BR>I hate you."
<BR>Again I ask the
<BR>difference between her
<BR>and me. Is it looks,
<BR>or inner personality
<BR>and the willingness
<BR>to love you?  Elizabeth
<BR>never loved you, because
<BR>she was stupid
<BR>enough to let you go.
<BR>
<BR>I let the train
<BR>pass me by last night;
<BR>the one I was taking
<BR>to get farther away
<BR>from my love for you.
<BR>My feelings for you
<BR>were so strong, I
<BR>could not let you go.
<BR>"Elizabeth, I hate you
<BR>with a passion, even though
<BR>I don't know you. And
<BR>I don't know why he's
<BR>so hung up on you."
<BR>What does she have
<BR>that I can't give you?
<BR>Late at night, thinking
<BR>of you, I hear her laughing
<BR>in the background.
<BR>I cry for hours
<BR>wishing you were there to
<BR>comfort me, but knowing
<BR>in your dreams is
<BR>Elizabeth and never me.
<BR>Why is Elizabeth so special to you?
<BR>Why can you never love me?
<BR>
<BR>Let her go, and return to
<BR>the present; think of
<BR>your future.
<BR>She is the past and doesn't
<BR>love you,
<BR>or she would be sitting
<BR>beside you right now.
<BR>If you tell me more about you,
<BR>instead of hiding it,
<BR>maybe I would understand
<BR>more than I do now.
<BR>But I hate Elizabeth, and
<BR>my feelings never will change
<BR>until you have the same
<BR>feelings for me I have for you,
<BR>but even then;
<BR>"Elizabeth, I will hate you."
<BR>Whatever connects you to
<BR>Elizabeth isn't worth it
<BR>unless she's there.
<BR>
<BR>My heart is broken,
<BR>and the pieces are
<BR>scattered everywhere
<BR>because no one love mw
<BR>as more than a friend,
<BR>and only that will keep my
<BR>heart in one piece.
<BR>
<BR>Not everyone will do.
<BR>No, only you. The one
<BR>who loves Elizabeth, who
<BR>loves another. Is she
<BR>keeping you happy even
<BR>when she is so far away?
<BR>Does she love you like
<BR>I love you? Does she
<BR>care about you? Why
<BR>did she let you go?
<BR>
<BR>"Elizabeth, I don't know  you,
<BR>but you are ruining my life."
<BR>What can she give
<BR>you that I don'
<BR>have to offer?
<BR>Why is her love,
<BR>though it's obvious
<BR>it's not there, more
<BR>important than mine
<BR>which is everlasting?
<BR>
<BR>Let go of your 
<BR>feelings of the past,
<BR>the ones that truly
<BR>don't mean a thing,
<BR>but are waiting to
<BR>be together with you
<BR>"darling" Elizabeth.
<BR>"Elizabeth, I hate you.
<BR>Because of you, my
<BR>life is full of
<BR>unhappiness, anger,
<BR>and tears that
<BR>roll down my face
<BR>when I think of him."
<BR>What does she have
<BR>that I don't? Why
<BR>do you love Elizabeth
<BR>and not me?
<BR>
<BR>The rain falls,
<BR>washing my tears
<BR>away, the sun comes
<BR>and dries them up,
<BR>but they always
<BR>return, along with my pain
<BR>of never having you, which
<BR>never goes away.
<BR>"Elizabeth, I hate you,
<BR>but I wish I were you.
<BR>What do you have that
<BR>makes you so special
<BR>to him? What about you
<BR>makes him love you?
<BR>Will he ever love me?
<BR>Elizabeth, I'll hate you forever."
<BR>
<BR>"You have someone that
<BR>loves you, but you turn away,
<BR>and he still wants you.
<BR>Forever, he will want you.
<BR>Elizabeth, I hate you."
