As I remember days
<BR>gone by,
<BR>I sit here with 
<BR>you in my heart
<BR>and a tear in my eye. I wait for you
<BR>every day,
<BR>wishing when you were
<BR>here, you said you
<BR>would stay.
<BR>Day by day,
<BR>night by night,
<BR>I wait for
<BR>you to be by my side.
<BR>My feelings for you,
<BR>I can no longer hide.
<BR>My love grows stronger
<BR>every day;
<BR>hoping when you
<BR>return, you'll hear
<BR>what I have to say.
<BR>I don't want to
<BR>say good-bye,
<BR>but if I lose you,
<BR>I know I'll die.
<BR>My heart longs
<BR>for the sweet words
<BR>you whisper to me
<BR>when we are together,
<BR>which I wish was
<BR>forever.
<BR>But time will tell,
<BR>and hearts will love.
<BR>Everyone asks me why
<BR>I wait for you and
<BR>I tell them because;
<BR>I love you,
<BR>and I can't wait until
<BR>I have you.
