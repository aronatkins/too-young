<H2>Lies</H2>
You tell them lies,
<BR>so I turn away,
<BR>but my love for you
<BR>will last, though it
<BR>shouldn't stay
<BR>because of the lies
<BR>told and the number
<BR>of times you broke my heart.
<BR>I'm to blame, too,
<BR>I shouldn't say the
<BR>only one to blame is you.
<BR>I let you stay within my heart
<BR>and wound me more every time you leave.
<BR>A tear rolls down my face
<BR>every time I think of when
<BR>you told me we were friends,
<BR>but then you turn your back on me,
<BR>and tell them lies.
<BR>You don't think I'll find out
<BR>because I'm not always there,
<BR>but my friends and my sister
<BR>tell me everything.
<BR>
<BR>I thought we were friends,
<BR>but every time someone
<BR>says my name, you turn
<BR>toward them with an angry look
<BR>upon your face and say;
<BR>obsessed. I cried last night,
<BR>all because of you.
<BR>You tell me we are friends,
<BR>but break the trust I had
<BR>for you by telling them lies.
<BR>You don't even think when you talk,
<BR>and every time you say
<BR>those lies about me,
<BR>the sword cuts deeper
<BR>into my soul,
<BR>wounding me emotionally
<BR>forever. But my love for you
<BR>will never go away,
<BR>because now, I have
<BR>turned the love I have
<BR>for you into the love I
<BR>have for you as a friend.
