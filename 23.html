<H2>Too Young</H2>
Saying good-bye
<BR>is the hardest thing to do.
<BR>There is all that
<BR>pain, loneliness, and sadness;
<BR>stored up inside you;
<BR>wanting to be let out.
<BR>Thinking of how different 
<BR>other people make you feel.
<BR>Isolated from the world.
<BR>Eleven is too young 
<BR>to watch  someone die.
<BR>Too young to stand by,
<BR>watching the pain of
<BR>everyone. Too young 
<BR>to stand by, next to her, 
<BR>watching your mother die.
<BR>Not being able to do anything for her,
<BR>like she did for you 
<BR>when you were little and fell down.
<BR>When that single tear,
<BR>starts to fall,
<BR>the door is unlocked,
<BR>for the world to step in,
<BR>and say they understand.
<BR>But they just make it worse.
<BR>Eleven is too young
<BR>to say good-bye.
