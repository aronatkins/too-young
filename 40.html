<H2>Best Friend</H2>
You, sitting all alone
<BR>with tears in your
<BR>gray eyes.
<BR>Listen closely because
<BR>what I have to say
<BR>is hard to say,
<BR>but important.
<BR>You've been there
<BR>for me through
<BR>everything. Despite
<BR>all of my tears, my anger,
<BR>and my fears, you have
<BR>been there to listen.
<BR>I love you, but not
<BR>just as a friend.
<BR>Mike, I love you
<BR>more than words
<BR>can say,
<BR>but my love isn't just
<BR>for today. My love is
<BR>undying, strong until
<BR>the end. My love is
<BR>like a rainbow, it will
<BR>be there after every
<BR>storm. My love is like the
<BR>sun; it shines bright
<BR>to show me the path
<BR>I want to take.
<BR>This is the first time
<BR>I have told you
<BR>of my love. The
<BR>love that started
<BR>so long ago and that
<BR>will never end.
<BR>Just because I have
<BR>told you my true
<BR>feelings, there is
<BR>no need to run
<BR>away, frightened of love.
<BR>I hope that we can
<BR>be friends and let
<BR>nothing come between up
<BR>because I don't
<BR>want to be without
<BR>a friend like you;
<BR>so sweet, caring, and
<BR>understanding.
<BR>Just remember;
<BR>I'll always
<BR>love you.
