Your smile is so heavenly.
<BR>As I look into your eyes,
<BR>I forget everything else around me
<BR>but you.
<BR>My feelings for you
<BR>are so strong, though you'll
<BR>never know.
<BR>Time passes by, but I'll never tell you
<BR>how I feel.
<BR>As we walk by each other,
<BR>we smile and say hi,
<BR>but exchange no other
<BR>words.
<BR>I long to tell you how
<BR>I feel, but I'm afraid
<BR>you don't feel the same way.
<BR>I don't want you to break
<BR>my heart,
<BR>because my tears
<BR>will never stop
<BR>falling down my face.
<BR>And your smile,
<BR>will ever again
<BR>look so heavenly.
<BR>You are someone I could
<BR>love forever,
<BR>but I don't want
<BR>to chance my heart,
<BR>because what if you
<BR>don't feel the same way
<BR>about me,
<BR>as I feel about you?
<BR>These questions run
<BR>through my mind,
<BR>day after day.
<BR>Will my questions
<BR>ever be answered?
<BR>Will my dreams
<BR>of having you
<BR>ever be fulfilled?
<BR>I wait for the
<BR>day questions
<BR>will be answered,
<BR>and dreams will
<BR>come true.
<BR>You are always on my mind,
<BR>always in my heart.
<BR>But until the day you know
<BR>of my love, we
<BR>will never have
<BR>the chance of being together,
<BR>unless you love me
<BR>but don't know how to show it,
<BR>or you are afraid, as I am,
<BR>that your heart
<BR>will be broken with
<BR>no one to pick up the pieces,
<BR>but I'll always love you.
<BR>If you need someone,
<BR>I'll always be there for you.
<BR>And if someone
<BR>breaks your heart,
<BR>I'll always be there to pick up the pieces.
