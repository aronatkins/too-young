<H2>Friendship throughout life</H2>
Knowing each other only
<BR>a little when we became
<BR>friends, who knew we ever 
<BR>had so much in common.
<BR>the worst thing that we
<BR>had in common, brought on
<BR>many fights. my sister also
<BR>brought on many fights.
<BR>that one thing so horrible
<BR>to have in common is that
<BR>we're both very stubborn
<BR>and think we are always right.
<BR>but even with all those fights,
<BR>we stopped fighting, and
<BR>eventually we started again.
<BR>but one thing that makes 
<BR>our friendship so different 
<BR>from others, is when we fight,
<BR>we always are friends in the
<BR>end. I hope that no matter 
<BR>what happens, we will stay
<BR>friends, always.
