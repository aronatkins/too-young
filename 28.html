<H2>Mama's Hands</H2>
As I walked in,
<BR>my mother held my 
<BR>hand.
<BR>As I look around,
<BR>I remembered the real
<BR>reason I was there. 
<BR>I walked over to her 
<BR>and looked upon her. 
<BR>I knelt and prayed 
<BR>in front of her, 
<BR>while she was looking 
<BR>over me 
<BR>for an eternity. 
<BR>I started crying, 
<BR>and soon the room 
<BR>filled up with hundreds 
<BR>of people who came 
<BR>to see her, who loved 
<BR>her. Everyone came 
<BR>up to me with their 
<BR>tear-streaked faces 
<BR>and said they were sorry. 
<BR>They told me things 
<BR>she would want me to do. 
<BR>But they weren't her, 
<BR>they didn't know what 
<BR>she would have wanted. 
<BR>I looked around and 
<BR>thought it wasn't
<BR>true and I told 
<BR>myself it was only 
<BR>a dream. I still held 
<BR>my mother's hand, 
<BR>looked up into her eyes, 
<BR>and hugged her. 
<BR>As I hugged her, I 
<BR>started crying, never 
<BR>wanting to let her go. 
<BR>Then, without her hand, 
<BR>I walked over to her 
<BR>again and looked down 
<BR>upon her. 
<BR>There she was still, 
<BR>lying in that coffin, 
<BR>death had stolen her life. 
<BR>As I whisper good-bye, 
<BR>I cry and remember her as 
<BR>my mother. No longer 
<BR>was there a hand to hold 
<BR>when I was afraid. 
<BR>There she was, say good-bye,
<BR>to my sweet and loving mother.
