When we met,
<BR>we were so different,
<BR>not knowing we were
<BR>the same.
<BR>We have so much in
<BR>common that we
<BR>never realized
<BR>until that time when
<BR>we became friends.
<BR>Since then,
<BR>you've always
<BR>been there for me,
<BR>through thick and thin.
<BR>Whenever I had to
<BR>cry, you were the first
<BR>to lend me a shoulder to
<BR>cry on, a consoling arm,
<BR>and some calming
<BR>words. How we became
<BR>such good friends
<BR>from two different worlds,
<BR>is beyond just words.
<BR>It looks deep into
<BR>spirit and soul,
<BR>and the many things
<BR>we share. For one,
<BR>our taste in guys is the same.
<BR>We have differences,
<BR>though. You;
<BR>the outgoing type
<BR>who always has to
<BR>have the first and
<BR>last word. Compared
<BR>to you, I'm as
<BR>shy and quiet as
<BR>it gets (I'm working
<BR>on it).Yet I believe
<BR>that our differences
<BR>along with our similarities
<BR>bring us closer together
<BR>as friends, within a
<BR>friendship I hope
<BR>lasts forever.
