<H2>My Brother</H2>
As long as I can remember;
<BR>since the day I was born,
<BR>his loving arms were waiting
<BR>to catch me when I fall.
<BR>He's always there to
<BR>help me and guide me
<BR>along the way,
<BR>and I can always
<BR>call him, no matter
<BR>what I have to say.
<BR>I tell him that I love him
<BR>from the bottom of my
<BR>heart, and he makes
<BR>me proud. No matter
<BR>how fat away he travels,
<BR>I know he's always
<BR>there. No matter the
<BR>arguments we get in,
<BR>I know he'll always care. I
<BR>always try to be there
<BR>for him, like he is for me,
<BR>though he's on his own.
<BR>When I think of
<BR>the times when we
<BR>were young, and just
<BR>sat in his room together;
<BR>just thinking of
<BR>the past makes
<BR>me smile and
<BR>then I can't wait
<BR>to see him. He moves
<BR>on with his life,
<BR>though I still wish
<BR>the days were still
<BR>when we were young.
<BR>But he goes off and 
<BR>builds his life.
<BR>And still, to this
<BR>very day, his loving
<BR>arms are there,
<BR>to help me along
<BR>the way. Now
<BR>brother, I say
<BR>to you, as long as
<BR>you are happy in
<BR>your life you
<BR>built since you 
<BR>left home, that's
<BR>all that matters.
<BR>Just remember,
<BR>I'll always 
<BR>be your sister and 
<BR>I'll always be 
<BR>here for you. But 
<BR>most important, 
<BR>remember; no 
<BR>matter what, 
<BR>I'll always love you.
