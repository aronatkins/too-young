<H2>The Shadow of Darkness</H2>
I walk in the
<BR>shadow of darkness,
<BR>and I cry alone.
<BR>The path I must take
<BR>is no longer clear to me,
<BR>ever since you left me.
<BR>The days have become long
<BR>and the hours endless,
<BR>ever since you were gone.
<BR>I wait in the
<BR>shadow of darkness,
<BR>and I cry alone.
<BR>The reasons of life
<BR>have faded before me,
<BR>ever since you walked
<BR>out of my life.
<BR>The tears roll down my face,
<BR>and I can't tell you
<BR>why they're falling.
<BR>I love you,
<BR>but you are gone.
<BR>I walk in the
<BR>shadow of darkness,
<BR>and I cry alone.
<BR>When you were here,
<BR>I was never alone;
<BR>you were always
<BR>by my side.
<BR>Every mistake I made,
<BR>you were there to comfort me,
<BR>and tell me everything
<BR>will be all right.
<BR>Whenever I cried,
<BR>you were there
<BR>to lend me a shoulder
<BR>to cry on,
<BR>and caring arms,
<BR>holding me until
<BR>I stopped crying.
<BR>You would whisper
<BR>consoling words
<BR>as I cried over the phone
<BR>late at night,
<BR>but now it doesn't matter.
<BR>You are gone.
<BR>I walk in the
<BR>shadow of darkness,
<BR>and I cry alone.
