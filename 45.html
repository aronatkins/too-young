Would you love me
<BR>If my hair was a different color,
<BR>My skin a different shade?
<BR>I can see you don't love me now,
<BR>But colors seem to make a difference.
<BR>
<BR>Would you love me if
<BR>The sky was black,
<BR>And the earth white?
<BR>Would you love me if all
<BR>You saw was red?
<BR>
<BR>Could you love me if
<BR>The colors of the world
<BR>Were what you wanted them to be
<BR>Instead of what they are?
<BR>
<BR>Would there be love between us
<BR>If I were different colors,
<BR>Colors that seem to make
<BR>Such a big difference in your life?
<BR>
<BR>You walk away,
<BR>As the colors fly with
<BR>The wind and
<BR>Color the earth.
<BR>
<BR>You tell me there's no
<BR>Going back,
<BR>And the colors won't be
<BR>That of love.,
<BR>But that of friendship.
<BR>
<BR>Do colors make you blind
<BR>To the world around you?
<BR>Do they shut your eyes so that
<BR>You can't see the colors of love?
<BR>
<BR>Would the colors change
<BR>How you see me,
<BR>And show you to love me?
<BR>
<BR>Do you still follow the colors,
<BR>Go wherever they take you,
<BR>To the worlds beyond,
<BR>With your colors of life
<BR>Exactly how you want them?
<BR>
<BR>Would you love me
<BR>If my hair was a different color,
<BR>My skin a different shade?
<BR>I can see you don't love me now,
<BR>But colors seem to make a difference.
